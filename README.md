# Early Education and Social Preferences-NBER
This paper examines the causal impact of early childhood education on social preferences of children. The paper compares children who, at 3-4 years old, were randomized into either a full-time preschool, a parenting program with incentives, or to a control group. We returned to the same children when they reached 7-8 years old and conducted a series of incentivized experiments to elicit their social preferences.
